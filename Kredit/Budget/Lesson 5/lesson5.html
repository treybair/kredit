                <br><br>You did it! You made a budget! Pat on the back for you. You have learned a ton of new information already, and now we&#39;re going to teach you how to apply it in real life. Yeah, we know we taught you what a budget is, big and important sounding financial terms, and how to make a budget. But here is the real test: can you stick to your budget IRL? It can be hard, especially at first. All it takes is some practice, learning from mistakes, and some life hacks to stretch that money.
                <br><br>Usually we talk about savings last, but we want to talk about it first this lesson. You may not be convinced you need a savings account or really get why it is important. We&#39;re going to run down through a few scenarios where having some savings comes in handy to keep your motivation up. Then, we&#39;re going to divulge some top secret tips for staying within your budget so you&#39;re not spending more money than you have (spoiler alert: this is a huge no-no!) 
                <br><br>So savings. We know, we know. We&#39;ve talked about it like a hundred times. Pop Quiz: Do you put money into savings or expenses first. SAVINGS, PEOPLE!! Every time. Here&#39;s why:
                <br><br>Let&#39;s say you really, REALLY want to go to this super awesome summer camp. It&#39;s an entire week of your favorite things (sports, video games, food, origami, you name it). But the catch is that it costs $600. And your parents say you have to pay HALF. 
                <br><br>Dude. That means you have to fork up $300 to go to this camp. Remember, you&#39;re only making $200 a month with the dog walking business. And the camp is in 2 months. But you still have to pay for your regular expenses. Let&#39;s review:
                <br><br>Income - Savings - Fixed Expenses = Amount available for Flexible Expenses
                <br><br>$200 - $20 - $65 = $115
                <br><br>So if the camp is in two months, and you save EVERY PENNY of your flexible expenses, you still only have $230 towards your camp ($115 x 2 months). You are $70 short of your portion of the camp payment. 
                <br><br>BUT WAIT! You&#39;ve been putting $20 into your savings account every month! You&#39;ve been sticking to your budget for about 6 months, plus or minus a few bucks here and there when you&#39;ve had a surplus or needed a few more dollars at the end of the month. 
                <br><br>$20 x 6 months = $120 in savings. You&#39;ll totally have enough! You will even have a $50 cushion in your savings account for the future. Man, you are a financial wizard. You&#39;re totally going to camp. See, savings are your secret little stash of cash that helps you pay for big time purchases. The reason you don&#39;t want to dig into your savings for everyday purchases is because then you won&#39;t have money for the stuff you really want or need. Savings help those big purchases happen sooner and with less financial strain.
                <br><br>Developing the self-discipline to keep your spending within the available limits is the single biggest skill that will lead to financial success. REMEMBER THIS: living within your means, staying within your budget, whatever you want to call it, will get you where you want to be financially. Just don&#39;t spend money you don&#39;t have. If you only have $115 toward flexible expenses every month, don&#39;t go spending $150 on a shopping trip every other week. The math will not work, you&#39;ll be screwed, and out of money when you really need it. 
                <br><br>Savings help when your income fluctuates and you need more than you think. Say your dog walking business gets really slow with summer vacation, and you only make $110. That means you are $90 short ($200 - $110 = $90) of your normal income. What do you do? Easy peasy. You, my friend, have prepared for this. Your fixed expenses of $65 are covered. You still have $25 left for flexible spending. In these situations, you gotta reign it in and spend less when possible. When not possible, your reserve will help you cover the necessary expenses during those cheaper months until your income is on the up and up again. 
                <br><br>See how amazing it is to be able to pay for the things you need and want? And you made that happen by preparing for the future! Give your past self a hug. Go ahead, we&#39;ll wait.
                <br><br>Okay, that&#39;s enough hugging. Now for the ultimate list of life hacks to make that money stretch. Here we will talk about how to save money on things you buy all the time, what you can cut back on without noticing, and what to stop paying for all together. 
                <br><br><samp class="bold font green">Save on the usual</samp> 
                <br>SALES. Sales will be your best friend (besides Kredit, obvs). Why buy your favorite pair of jeans for $75 when you can wait 3 weeks and they&#39;ll be on sale for 40% off? Quick, do the math: what is 40% off of $75? You will save $30! That&#39;s like, 3 pizza nights, 3 movies, or a full tank of gas. Dude, you&#39;re awesome. The key to saving with sales? Patience, my young grasshopper. No really, patience. You just gotta wait. Keep an eye out for sales from your favorite stores and stuff you usually buy.
                <br><br><samp class="bold font green">It pays to be loyal</samp>
                <br>Sign up for email notifications or download the app for your favorite places to shop. Punch cards are a thing of the past, but most places continue their reward programs electronically using apps or phone numbers. Sometimes you&#39;ll get an exclusive discount, BOGO deals, or perks for being members of their rewards program. It doesn&#39;t cost you anything (other than a few extra notifications) and you can save money on things you normally buy. Our tip: don&#39;t sign up for anything you wouldn&#39;t want to see anyways. Those emails can add up and get super annoying. 
                <br><br><samp class="bold font green">No brand, no prob</samp>
                <br>Buy the generic brand of items when it is possible. It can be so much cheaper and sometimes it is exactly the same product, just labeled differently. When you spend $9 for the fancy bottled water verses $2 for the random store brand, you are making a bad choice. Rethink your life decisions right now. Figure out the cheapest gas station along your normal route and make sure to stop there when you&#39;re running on E instead of rolling into the closest one. Buy the same stuff, just do it cheaper. 
                <br><br><samp class="bold font green">Scale Back</samp>
                <br>We get it. You&#39;re always hungry. You can eat the XL burrito AND two tacos AND a bowl of chips and salsa. But really, do you need all that? Scale back before you spend money. For food— don&#39;t go for the larger sizes when you can just refill. Decide how hungry you really are and how much you actually need because you probably don&#39;t need all that food (your tummy and your wallet will thank you)! Sure, to size up it is only an extra buck. But an extra buck every single time you eat out adds up! Going to the movies? Get the popcorn, skip the candy. Same thing applies with clothing and longer-lasting purchases. You kind of like those headphones, but you don&#39;t love them. Don&#39;t buy them! If you keep thinking about them, and decide it is worth it, then that is a green light. (You might even find them cheaper somewhere else!) If you don&#39;t really keep thinking about them, or you&#39;re still not convinced it&#39;s a great purchase, skip it and keep looking for something better. Basically—value that money enough to hold onto it. Only let it go for things that are really worth it. 
                <br><br><samp class="bold font green">Drop it like it&#39;s hot</samp>
                <br>There are probably things you&#39;re paying for that you should not be paying for. Like a rando music subscription service that you don&#39;t use. (Or that you do use but don&#39;t even like that much.) Or that free trial you forgot to cancel and is now charging your card $13 a month. Get rid of that ish. You will not even notice that it&#39;s gone and you&#39;ll be so glad for the extra change every month. 
                <br><br>Phew! We know that was a lot of information. Let&#39;s review real quick. 
                <br><br>Put money into your savings first. Savings save your a$$ when in a jam or when a big purchase comes up. Huh. Maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s called savings. Don&#39;t spend more money than you have. It will never work, just trust us. Find ways to pay less for the same things. Buy less. Get rid of money drains and wasters. 
                <br><br>Okay? Okay! You got this! You are basically a financial guru now. You know how to be smart about spending your money so you get the best bang for your buck.
